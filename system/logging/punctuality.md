# Punctuality & Dependability (Wraps)

Goal: align with standard Wraps worker expectations for arrival/dependability to rebuild trust with leadership (Steve/Caso, Chris) and drop old leniency patterns.

Plan:
- Track daily arrival/commitment times until this becomes routine.
- Surface a daily reminder/checklist in the routine (agents) to confirm on-time start.
- Optionally log deviations privately for self-review (not in repo).

Where:
- Reference this in personal routines; update when resolved.
